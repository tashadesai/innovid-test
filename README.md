# innovid-test

Built using JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap.

Work Process: 
I started by deciding what technologies to use. Since it's a small project with a time constraint I kept it lightweight with React on the frontend and without a heavy backend. The API calls are included in a React component for this same reason (as opposed to building out a backed for API endpoints which I would do for a larger project). My first priority was to figure out the best way to load product data from the API, then building a basic skeleton in HTML, and finally to add styling using Bootstrap.
